- This project is a hands-on tutorial and mini-project that teaches how to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data using SQL. It focuses on practical skills with two popular relational database systems: MySQL and PostgreSQL. The tutorial includes real-world task: reporting, aggregation, cleaning, joins, window functions, and indexing.

- Tables (Entities): Names of tables and what each represents

- Columns (Attributes/Fields): The specific data each table stores (e.g., customer_id, name, email).

- Includes data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE): Defines whether fields can be NULL or NOT NULL.

- Primary Key (PK): unique identifier for each record.

- Foreign Key (FK): links between tables, enforcing relationships.

- Unique constraints: ensures no duplicate values in a column

- Relationships: How tables connect (one-to-many, many-to-many).

- Constraints: Rules for data integrity (CHECK, DEFAULT, NOT NULL).

- Create databases and tables in MySQL and PostgreSQL.

- Load CSV data into tables using COPY (Postgres) or LOAD DATA INFILE (MySQL).

- Write SELECT queries with filtering, sorting, and joins.

- Use aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING).

- Work with window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), SUM() OVER(...)).

- Perform data updates, deletes, and safe upserts (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT / INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE).

- Create indexes and understand query plans (EXPLAIN).

- Export query results.
