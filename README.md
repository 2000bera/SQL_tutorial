- Tables (Entities): Names of tables and what each represents

- Columns (Attributes/Fields): The specific data each table stores (e.g., customer_id, name, email).

- Includes data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE): Defines whether fields can be NULL or NOT NULL.

- Primary Key (PK): unique identifier for each record.

- Foreign Key (FK): links between tables, enforcing relationships.

- Unique constraints: ensures no duplicate values in a column

- Relationships: How tables connect (one-to-many, many-to-many).

- Constraints: Rules for data integrity (CHECK, DEFAULT, NOT NULL).
